# High-Performance Scientific Computing for Astrophysics
# Astro 528:  Spring 2019
## Scope & Sprit of the Course

{{%excerpt%}}
_High-Performance Scientific Computing for Astrophysics_ will combine class discussion and programming exercises to train students in the use of modern computing hardware and programming strategies for application to astronomy and astrophysics research.  Students will gain experience applying these practices during a class project (potentially in support of the student’s dissertation research).

While it is primarily intended for graduate students in the astronomy & astrophysics program, it is likely also beneficial for graduate students in other physical sciences and engineering.

This course can count toward the Penn State [Graduate Minor in Computational Science](http://www.csci.psu.edu/).  It is complementary to [Phys/Astro 587 _Computational Physics/Astrophysics_](https://bulletins.psu.edu/search/?scontext=courses&search=Astro+527&caturl=%2Fgraduate), the recent [Astro 585: _Astrostatistics_](https://bulletins.psu.edu/search/?scontext=courses&search=Astro+585&caturl=%2Fgraduate) and [Stat/IST 557: _Data Mining_](https://bulletins.psu.edu/search/?scontext=courses&search=Stat+557&caturl=%2Fgraduate).  The combination of these four courses with the domain expertise from their Ph.D. program would provide students with an excellent introduction to “[Data Science](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws.drewconway.com/viz/venn_diagram/data_science.html)”.

The primary goal is for students to improve their skills in scientific computing, including programming practices for achieving reproducible results and high-performance scientific computing with an eye towards scaling up to larger problems and “[Big Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)”.  To achieve this, students will develop a basic understanding of modern computer architectures, memory systems, programming languages and common programming patterns.  Exercises provide students with experience applying established programming practices (e.g., version control, coding standards, testing, debugging, profiling, documenting and reviewing code) and optimizing performance using multi-core processors, clusters, GPUs and (hopefully) cloud computing.

All of these objectives may not be realized within the one-semester course, and we will adapt the scope and emphasis based on student interests and programming experience.  The version of the syllabus on the course website will be updated throughout the semester and supersede the printed version.  Students should check the website regularly for updates.
