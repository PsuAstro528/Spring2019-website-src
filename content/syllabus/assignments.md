The assessed work for this course consists of computer lab/homework assignments (50%) and a class project (50%).  There are no exams.  The class project will have several components and will be described in more detail below.  

The planned assignment due dates are in the schedule section of the syllabus.  Any revision to the due dates will be announced at the time they are assigned.  Assignments are due at least an hour prior to the beginning of class on the day they are due.  If the University is closed on the due date of an assignment (due to bad weather or any other reason), then the assignment will be due one hour before the next class session.  


## Homework exercises
Early in the semester, homework assignments will be assigned once a week.  Later in the semester, homework assignments will become shorter and/or less frequent, since you will be working on your class project.  Students will begin each homework exercise by following a link that will create a clone of the starter git repository.  Students are to read and think about the questions posted, and add/edit code as suggested in the exercise, making small commits as they go.   _Homework exercises are to be submitted by issuing a pull request_ from the student's github repository.

Most assignments will not have a unique solution, and comparing the accuracy and/or performance of different solutions will likely prove educational.  Therefore, rather than providing “the solution”, we will typically discuss selected student solutions during class to help illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches.  

The homework assignments are designed to be educational.  The experience of working on the assignment is more valuable than having “the solution”.  As this is a three credit class, it is expected that students will devote an average of 5 hours per week to the course outside of class.  If we estimate an average of ~1 hour/week for reading, then that leaves ~4 hours per week to work on homework assignments or your class project outside of class.  If a student completes a homework assignment with less than ~2 hours of effort, then I would encourage them to go beyond the minimum to complete the assignment and try to come up with an even more efficient solution to the problem or to devote extra time to their project.  Conversely, if you have done the readings, participated in class and devoted 4 hours of focused effort outside of class to a homework assignment, then you should stop coding!  At that point, write up a short description of what you've done, what's working, what problems you've encountered and what you think you would try next.  Don't let one homework assignment take an unreasonable amount of your time.  I will adjust the length and difficulty of the homework assignments based on what students turn in.  Since some students will have more programming experience than others, I will try to make each homework assignment somewhat more than the average student can do in 4 hours, so that all students are challenged.  If you are so interested that you choose to work longer on a homework assignment, then please create and tag a commit with where you were after 4 hours of focused effort, so that I have a realist idea of how much students are accomplishing in a reasonable amount of time.  

## Class Projects
The class project (worth a total of 50% of final grade) includes the following key elements:

- a written proposal outlining your project (5%), 
- implementing a solution to your problem that passes your tests and uses programming practices from class in time for the peer code review (10%), 
- performing a helpful code review on a peer's project (5%; see example code review checklist), 
- optimizing performance for a multi-core shared-memory system (i.e., modern workstation; 10%), 
- optimizing performance using either a distributed memory system (e.g., cluster), a many-core accelerator (e.g., GPU or Intel Phi), or on the cloud (e.g., Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Domino) (10%), and 
- a ~15 minute presentation (including time for questions) to the class describing your project, comparing the performance of different versions of your code as a function of problem size, and describing lessons learned (10%).  

### Project Proposals
Students are encouraged to propose a project that closely relates to their research interests.  Student are strongly encouraged to discuss their ideas with the instructor far enough in advance of the deadline, that they can refine or change plans prior to the proposal due date.  If you have no idea and would like the instructor to suggest a project, then let the instructor know by the end of the first week.  

The written proposal should include:

- the project goal, 
- a description of the inputs, 
- a description of the outputs, 
- a detailed plan for how the code will be tested, 
- a discussion of the relevant range of problem sizes, 
- what computer architectures, programming languages, and libraries you will use, as well as an justification of your choices.  

For more information about the expectations for class projects and grading rubrics will be provided.


## Readings & Reading Questions
Students will be expected to read assignments (or review a website, watch an online presentation, or listen to audio) before class on the days indicated, so they will be prepared to participate in class discussions and/or make progress writing code for the assignment.  

All students should submit at least one question about the day’s readings via email to the instructor with "Astro 528" in the subject line at least _one hour prior_ to each discussion-based class (as opposed to lab classes).  The hour before class is important, so the instructor will have time to read the questions and plan how to organize the day’s discussion.  Submitting questions via email is particularly important for any student who are reluctant to ask questions in class.  

 
## Class Participation
In-class discussions and coding sessions will be an important part of the course, so students should attend regularly.  If you know you need to miss class due to research travel, then let the instructor know in advance and make plans to get a classmate's notes for those sessions. 

My intention is for the homework portion of the class grade to be based solely on written assignments and code.  However, if I feel that some students are likely to benefit from having a greater incentive to engage in class more actively, then up to 20% of the homework score (i.e., 10% of the course grade) may be based on class participation, as measured by contributing to in-class discussion and/or submitting questions in advance of class.  

## Timeliness of assignments
Students should start all assignments well before the due date, so they can resolve any technical difficulties well in advance of the deadline.  Since assignments will typically be discussed in class on the day they are due, credit will be given based on what is submitted prior to class.  In cases where turning in assignments on time is not practical due to illness, family emergency, or other university-approved excuse, assignments should still be completed and turned in, but those assignments may not be included when computing the course grade.  If portions of the class project totalling more than 10% of course grade can not be completed before the course end date due to illness, family emergency, etc., then the student can elect to receive a “deferred grade” (DF) and to submit the remaining portions of the project no later than eight weeks after the course end date.  Students electing this option should be familiar with the [PSU DF policies](http://handbook.psu.edu/content/deferred-grade).
