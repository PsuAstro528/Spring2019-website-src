## Prerequisites
This course is designed for Astronomy & Astrophysics graduate students.  While Astro 501 is listed as a corerequsite by the registrar, that is primarily a formality, so that non-Astrophysics students will contact me to discuss their background before registering.  Previously, we have had some graduate students from physics and engineering who did very well in the course.  Of course, some extra thought may be required to figure out how concepts from the course presented in the context of astronomy or astrophysics could be applied to their own field of study.  

Entering Astronomy & Astrophysics graduate students span a wide range in terms of level of experience with programming.  The goal is for all students to improve their understanding of computing, software development skills and programming patterns, regardless of whether they enter as a novice or experienced programmer.  Students entering with significant computing skills should aim to achieve more than students entering with minimal experience.  Astronomy graduate students who are not already familiar with using the Unix/Linux/OS X command line interface and/or with no programming experience are encouraged to take the course, but should be prepared to put in some extra effort early in the semester.  If you let me know about your background, I can suggest some resources to help you get started and/or schedule a time to meet with you to answer questions.  

## Computing Requirements
We anticipate that students will have access to a laptop computer to work on exercises during classes (pairing up is ok) and regular access to a laptop or workstation outside of clas.  While some students may find it convenient to install software locally (e.g., [Julia](http://julialang.org/downloads/), [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client), [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)), others may choose to complete assignments using web-based resources, including Penn State's [Advanced CyberInfrastructure (ACI)](https://ics.psu.edu/computing-services/) operated by the Institute for CyberScience, [JuliaBox](http://juliabox.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/).  Some assignments (once we get to parallelization) will be most easily completed using ACI, so all students should plan to get an account and use ACI during the later parts of the course.

## Accounts

- Students should [request an ACI account](https://ics.psu.edu/computing-services/account-setup/), specifying ebf11 as the sponsor account and listing Astro528 as the research description.  Students who already have an ACI account should contact [i-ASK](https://iask.aci.ics.psu.edu/) to request that they add your account to the Astro 528 group.
- Students should create an account on [GitHub](http://github.com/).  Note that we will examine and discuss student's code both during class and via peer code review.  Students may choose to protect their privacy by choosing a github account id that does not identify them.  Students may wish to create a separate github account just for this class, so as to avoid being identified by other projects.  
- Prior to the second class meeting, students should send the instructor their PSU and GitHub userids.
