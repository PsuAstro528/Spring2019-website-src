Note:
Jupyter Notebooks enable instructors and students to integrate text, equations, figures, and computer code into lessons and assignments. Git, a distributed version control system, enables multiple contributors such as instructors, students, colleagues to efficiently update and improve curricular materials and assignments. GitHub Classroom allows instructors to see student submissions and provide detailed feedback on their work. This session will explain how these three technologies were integrated into a 2019 graduate-level class and discuss how these similar approaches could be applied and adapted for larger courses.

## Outline
- Four Valuable Tools for Education
- The Problem (combinging them)
- My Solution
- Room for Further Improvements
- Discussion
---
## Four Valuable Tools
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

---
## Git
- Distributed version control
- Works well for wide variety of projects from small to large
- Facilitates collaboration
- Open-source
- Valuable skill to develop   
___
## What is Git good for?
- Software development
   - Linux kernel
   - Small packages
- Documentation
- Websites
- Workflows
___
## What is Git good for?
### (in educational setting)
Curricular materials
   - Reading Materials
   - Syllabus
   - Assignments*
   - Presentations**

\* This gets more complicated.  More on this later.

\*\* Using less-common presentation tools, e.g., [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/)

---
## [GitHub](https://github.com/)*
Cloud-based git servers and web interfaces that add valuable collaboration tools:
- Managing _Pull Requests_: Submit, Discuss, Merge,...
- Code Review
- Bug/issue tracking
- Documentation
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
De facto standard for distributing and maintaining open-source software

\* Other alternatives include [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Penn State's GitLab server](https://git.psu.edu/).

---
## GitHub Classroom
- Integrates with [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)
- Automates repository creation and access control
- Distribute starter code
- Collect assignments on GitHub
- Offers free private repositories for educational uses

## Jupyter
- Browser-based _notebooks_ provide an interactive development environment
- Notebooks are __interactive__ documents that contain narrative text, equations, __live__ code, __live__ output and/or visualizations
- JSON format stores a complete record of the user's session
- Supports ~40 programming languages

## Demo of interactive Jupyter notebook
[![TLT Demo Notebook](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PsuAstro528/TLTDemo-start/main?filepath=ex1.ipynb)
___
## What is a Jupyter notebook good for?
- Data wrangling (cleaning, visualizing, transforming)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization
- Statistical modeling/machine learning
- Report generation
- Interactive Development Environment*

\* Many feel Jupyter notebooks are inferior to traditional IDEs for traditional software development.
___
## What is a Jupyter notebook good for?
### (in educational setting)
- Interactive lessons
- Tutorials
- Assignments involving data analysis or computation
- Document of a student's work and decision making process

---
## The Problem
Comparison of two versions of a Jupyter notebook:
- Many differences in meta-data
- Effectively not human-readable
- Important differences hard to isolate
- Interferes with code review, feedback and discussion.
___
Comparing Jupyter notebooks directly
<img data-src="/images/github_pr_ipynb.png" width="100%">
---
## One Solution

- Key idea:  Version control and compare _Markdown_ versions of notebooks.
___
Comparing Jupyter notebooks exported to Markdown

GitHub Classroom Workflow:
### 1. Instructor creates assignment:
1. Create personal git _repository (repo)_ with Jupyter notebook(s) for each assignment, including instructions, starter code, input data, etc.
2. Convert Jupyter notebooks into _Markdown_ format
3. Recreate Jupyter notebooks from _Markdown_
4. Create clean __template repository__
5. Distribute link to assignment via GitHub Classroom
___
### What goes into the template repository?

- Starter notebook(s) in both Jupyter & markdown formats
- Any other files needed (e.g., input data, license, dependanices, Docker config)
- Test scripts
- config for CI testing (e.g., [Travis-CI.com](ttps://travis-ci.com/)) (optional)

- Branches:
   - _main_: where students will complete assignment
   - _original_: copy of starting files in _main_ branch
   - _solution_: allows students to see your solutions (optional)
___
GitHub Classroom Workflow:  
### 2.  Student does assignment:
1. Follow link to create a private repo with starter files
2. Clone the repository to their local computer (or ACI)
3. Complete assignment(s) as Jupyter notebooks
4. Perform tests and revise (optional)

___
GitHub Classroom Workflow:  
### 3.  Student submits assignment:
1. Convert Jupyter notebooks into _Markdown_ format
2. Commit _Markdown_ files into main branch
3. Push local files to their repo on GitHub.
4. Confirm code passes automated tests (hopefully)
5. Submit a __pull request__ via GitHub to merge main branch into original branch
___
GitHub Classroom Workflow:  
### 4. Discuss assignment collaboratively
Instructor:

- Update template repository with more tests (optional)

Student & Instructor:  

- Check if code passes automatic tests
___
Automated testing provides prompt feedback

___
GitHub Classroom Workflow:  
### 5. Discuss assignment collaboratively
Instructor:  

- Review specific lines of code/equations/text that student changed (as Markdown).
- Provide feedback

Student:  

- Discuss, make changes, update/make new pull requests

Iterate!
___

---

## Room for Further Improvements
- Automate generation of clean assignment from solutions (create grammar, writer script)
- Reduce command-line operations for students
   - Automate process of generating markdown version via git hooks
- Consider new tools/commercial services emerging
