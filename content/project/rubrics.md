## Class Project
The class project consists of several parts, each of which has its own submission deadline.  It is particularly important that you provide code for peer review on time, so that your peer reviewer is able to provide thoughtful and helpful feedback in time for it to improve your code for the latter parts of the project.  The project grade will be based on:

- Project Proposal (5 points)
- Checkpoint 1: Serial version of code (10 points)
- Checkpoint 2: Multi-core version of code (10 points)
- Peer code reviews (5 points)
- Checkpoint 3: Distributed/GPU/Cloud version of code (10 points)
- Project Presentation (10 points)

The grading rubric for each part of the proposal is provided below.

### Project Proposal 

- Statement of the project goal (0 points, but required so the rest makes sense)
- Description of the inputs (1 point)
- Description of the outputs (1 point)
- Detailed plan for how the code will be tested (1 point)
- Discussion of the relevant range of problem sizes (1 point)
- Complete list of what computer architectures, programming languages, and libraries you will use, as well as an justification of your choices (1 point)


### Checkpoint 1: Serial version of code
(10 points total)

- Code performs proposed tasks (1 point)
- Comprehensive set of unit tests, at least one integration or regression test (1 point)
- Code passes tests (1 point)
- Student code uses a version control system (1 point)
- Repository includes many regular, small commits (1 point)
- Documentation for functions' purpose and design (1 point)
- Comprehensive set of assertions (1 point)
- Variable/function names consistent, distinctive & meaningful (1 point)
- Useful & consistent code formatting & style (1 point)
- Code is modular, rather than having chunks of same code copied and pasted (1 point)
  
### Checkpoint 2: Multi-core version of code
(10 points total)

- Choice of portion of code to parallelize (1 point)
- Choice of approach for parallelizing code (1 point)
- Code performs proposed tasks (2 point)
- Unit/regression tests comparing serial & parallel versions (1 point)
- Code passes tests (1 point)
- General code efficiency (1 point)
- Implementation/optimization of multi-core parallelization (2 points)	
- Significant performance improvement (1 point)


### Checkpoint 3: Distributed/GPU/Cloud version of code
(10 points total)

- Choice of portion of code to parallelize (1 point)
- Choice of approach for parallelizing code (1 point)
- Code performs proposed tasks (2 point)
- Unit/regression tests comparing serial & parallel versions (1 point)
- Code passes tests (1 point)
- General code efficiency (1 point)
- Implementation/optimization of second type of parallelism (2 points)	
- Significant performance improvement (1 point)

### Peer Code Reviews 
(5 points total)

- Constructive suggestions for improving programming practices (1 point)
- Specific, constructive suggestions for improving code readability/documentation (1 point)
- Specific, constructive suggestions for improving tests and/or assertions (1 point)
- Specific, constructive suggestions for improving code modularity/organization/maintainability (1 point)
- Specific, constructive suggestions for improving code efficiency (1 point)
- Finding any bugs (if code author confirms) (bonus points?)

### Project Presentation
(10 points total)

- Motivation/Introduction/Overview, so class can understand broader goals (1 point)
- Explanation of specific calculation being performed, so class can understand what follows (1 point)
- Analysis/explanation of most time consuming part(s) of calculations (1 point)
- Analysis/explanation of how time required scales with problem size (1 point)
- Description of optimization and parallelziation approaches attempted (1 point)
- Analysis/explanation of performance comparison for different versions of code (2 point)
- Description/analysis/discussion of what lessons you learned from the class project (2 points)
- Overall clarity of presentation (1 points)
