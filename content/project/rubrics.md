## Class Project
The class project consists of several parts, each of which has its own submission deadline.  It is particularly important that you provide code for peer review on time, so that your peer reviewer is able to provide thoughtful and helpful feedback in time for it to improve your code for the latter parts of the project.  The project grade will be based on:

- Project Proposal (5 points)
- Checkpoint 1: Serial version of code (10 points)
- Checkpoint 2: Multi-core version of code (10 points)
- Peer code reviews (5 points)
- Checkpoint 3: Distributed/GPU/Cloud version of code (10 points)
- Project Presentation (10 points)

The grading rubric for each part of the proposal is provided below.
