Students are encouraged to choose a class project that coudl benefit their research interests.  Students who have not started their dissertation research may ask the instructor for project suggestions.

For the class project, students will put into practice the software development practices they learn in this course, including assertions, tests, documentation, version control, modular design, and packaing for easy resuse by others.  Students will participate in a peer code review process to identify opportunities to improve their coding.  

Next, students will identify an appropriate portion of the code to optimize, optimize it for serial computation, and compare benchmark results.  Students will parallelize the an appropriate portion of the code for two different computing architectures and explore how their code performance scales.  In the final report and presentation, students will describe their findings and lessons learned, so the full class can learn from their experience.   

The regular homework exercises are designed to provide the scafolding to help students succeed with a class project.  In any weeks where you complete the homework exercises quickly, consider making progress on your class project.  While students will choose different projects, all should share the same key elements:

- Project Proposal
- Serial Code that passes tests (serial)
- First Peer Code Review (of serial code)
- Code parallelized for multi-Pcore system
- Second Peer Code Review (of parallelized code)
- Code parallelized for distributed-memory, accelerator or cloud
- Presentation to class
- Documentation and packaging of code for reuse by others

See the grading rubric for details of the expectations for each part of the project.
