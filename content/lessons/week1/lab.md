- If you're waiting on getting your account on ICS-ACI, then you could using [JuliaBox.com](https://www.juliabox.com).
- If JuliaBox gives you trouble, then you could use [mybinder.org] to start tinkering on the assignments.  (Links to: [Ex 1](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PsuAstro528/lab1-start/master?filepath=ex1.ipynb) and [Ex 2](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PsuAstro528/lab1-start/master?filepath=ex2.ipynb))
However, you will not be able to save your work directly to a github repository when using mybinder.org.  Instead, you could use File.Download As.Notebook to download your notebook before exiting your session.  Then you could copy it into your github repository.  While this is workable for the first few labs, you'll need to get ACI or JuliaBox working for assignments later on where performance is actually important part of the assignment.
