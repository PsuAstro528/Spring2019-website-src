{{%excerpt%}}
- Describe steps a CPU performs surrounding actual arithmetic
- Anticipate when performance will be affected by cache size
- Project
   - Plan data structures to optimize for memory access 
   - Profile code to identify code worth optimizing
   - Document code to increase chances of useful feedback from peer code review

## Lessons along the way
- Bus 
- Registers
- FPUs
- Prefetch
- Pipelining
- Out of order execution
- Cache: levels, lines, latency, associative
- Code introspection
- Type stability: `@code_warntype`
- Strict typing, sub-types, union types
- Performance impact of `global`'s
